/**
 * \par Description:
 * This API sets phone password without performing any checks connected with provided password. It
 * should be used only if user forgot the password.
 *
 * \par Purpose:
 * This API should be used by DPM(device policy manager) or enterprise manager when the user forgot his/her
 * phone password.
 *
 * \par Typical use case:
 * User forgets the password. He calls emergency manager(auto or manual), which means DPM or enterprise manager, for reset password. Emergency manager calls this API and reset phone password.
 *
 * \par Method of function operation:
 * Resetting phone password with input string without any matching current password. Function does
 * no checks before password replacement (expiration time check, currently set password checks,
 * history check and attempt count check are skipped).
 *
 * \par Sync (or) Async:
 * This is a Synchronous API.
 *
 * \par Important notes:
 *
 *
 * \param[in] passwd_type Password type, such as normal(lock) password, recovery password and so on.
 * \param[in] uid Target user.
 * \param[in] new_passwd Null terminated new password string or NULL.
 *            If you want to remove password you must set:
 *            new_pwd = NULL.
 *
 * \return AUTH_PASSWD_API_SUCCESS
 * \return AUTH_PASSWD_API_ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED
 * \return AUTH_PASSWD_API_ERROR_SOCKET
 * \return AUTH_PASSWD_API_ERROR_INPUT_PARAM
 *              passwd_type is not supported
 *              or password length is longer than MAX_PASSWORD_LEN.
 *
 * \par Prospective clients:
 * Platform's THE ONLY DPM and some dedicated privileged processes
 *
 * \par Known issues/bugs:
 * None
 *
 * \pre None
 *
 * \post None
 *
 * \see auth_passwd_check_passwd_state(), auth_passwd_check_passwd(), auth_passwd_set_passwd_recovery()
 *
 * \remarks Only DPM and enterprise manager can call this API. The password file will be access controlled and securely hashed. Auth-fw will remain previous password file to recover unexpected password file corruption.
 *
 * \par Sample code:
 * \code
 * #include <auth-passwd-admin.h>
 * ...
 * int ret;
 *
 * ret = auth_passwd_check_passwd_state(AUTH_PWD_NORMAL, owner_user, "This_is_current_passwd");
 * if(ret == AUTH_PASSWD_API_ERROR_INPUT_PARAM)
 * {
 *      printf("%s", "Password type is wrong or password is so long\n");
 * }
 * else if(ret == AUTH_PASSWD_API_SUCCESS)
 * {
 *      printf("%s", "Password is valid by now\n");
 * }
 * else
 * {
 *      printf("%s", "Something wrong\n");
 * }
 * ...
